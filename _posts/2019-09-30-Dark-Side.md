We show that TTOM has a lot to offer for the study of the evolution of cultures, but that this also brings to the fore the dark implications of TTOM, unexposed in Veissi√®re et al. Those implications lead us to move beyond meme-centered or an organism-centered concepts of fitness based on free energy minimization, towards a social systems-centered view.
