The determinants of affect proposed by the appraisal theory, the goal-directed theory, and the predictive processing theory are compared. The first theory attaches a role to multiple factors (goal-related factors, expectation-related factors, and control), the second theory only focuses on goal-related factors, and the third theory only focuses on expectation-related factors. We hold each of the theories against the light of (some) empirical evidence and examine whether the increase in parsimony of the second and third theories comes at a cost of scope or whether there are ways around it.
